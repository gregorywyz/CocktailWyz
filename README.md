# GA_Project_01
Cocktail finder and shopping list

This app was built on the node.js platform.  Many different node modules were used to create a simple CRUD app.  Express.js communicated from the backend to AJAX front end to work with data.  I wanted to show data that could take in measurements and standardize them for displaying purposes. The inconsistancy in the data would have been too much to take on.  Bootstrap was used to style the app.
