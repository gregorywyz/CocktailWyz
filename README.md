# Cocktail Wyz
General Assembly Prject #1

This app was built on the node.js platform.  Many different node modules were used to create a simple CRUD app.  Express.js communicated from the backend to AJAX front end to work with data.  I wanted to show data that could take in measurements and standardize them for displaying purposes. The inconsistancy in the data would have been too much to take on.  Bootstrap was used to style the app.

# Purpose
CocktailWyz is a web app built by Greg Wyszynski to project specs from General Assembly as a required deliverable for the Web Development Immersive Course. The project showcases skills learned over a few short weeks that started with learning Javascript fundamentals all the way to deploying a live app.

# Description
CocktailWyz is a search and find app for drink recipes. The app also has a social photo sharing feed to provide some inspiration and add to the enjoyment of the users. Basic usage involves searching for a drink and recieving a list of drinks from the API. All drinks then link to a page that describes them and offers the recipe. Additionally, users can securely sign up and have the options of creating a shopping list or favorites list. Users can add and delete items to both lists as desired.

# Technology
Built on the Node.js platform using a PostgreSQL database system and deployed on Heroku.

Modules used include: Express, EJS, bcrypt, request, lodash, and async.

# External APIs
Used data from http://www.bigoven.com/, and https://instagram.com/.

# What I Like Most
As this is my first web app ever. I am very proud of being able to accomplish launching a live app after only studying coding for a few weeks and so it in an environment that is widely used in the industry

# What I Like Least
I did not put enough thought into the project idea and had a lot of trouble finding an API that would work how I envisioned.
