# Cocktail Wyz
General Assembly Project #1

## Description
CocktailWyz is a search and find app for drink recipes. The app also has a social photo sharing feed to provide some inspiration and add to the enjoyment of the users. Basic usage involves searching for a drink and recieving a list of drinks from the API. All drinks then link to a page that describes them and offers the recipe. Additionally, users can securely sign up and have the options of creating a shopping list or favorites list. Users can add and delete items to both lists as desired.

## Purpose
CocktailWyz is a web app built by Greg Wyszynski to project specs from General Assembly as a required deliverable for the Web Development Immersive Course. The project showcases skills learned over a few short weeks that started with learning Javascript fundamentals all the way to deploying a live app.

## Technology
Built on the Node.js platform using a PostgreSQL database system and deployed on Heroku. AJAX was used to perform CRUD actions without the need of refreshing the page. RESTful routing and MVC were also incorporated into the project. The Bootstrap css framework was then used for styling.

Modules used include: Express, EJS, bcrypt, request, lodash, and async.

## External APIs
Used data from http://www.bigoven.com/, and https://instagram.com/.

## What I Like Most
As this is my first web app ever. I am very proud of being able to accomplish launching a live app after only studying coding for a few weeks and so it in an environment that is widely used in the industry

## What I Like Least
I did not put enough thought into the project idea and had a lot of trouble finding an API that would work how I envisioned.
